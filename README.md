# Email Insights NLP

**Email Insights NLP** is a FastAPI-based application designed to extract insights from email images. The project involves two main components: an OCR model for text extraction from images and an NLP model for extracting structured details such as email addresses, brands, and priorities from the extracted text.

## Project Overview

The project consists of:
1. **OCR Model:** Extracts text from email images.
2. **NLP Model:** Processes the extracted text to identify and extract key details.
3. **FastAPI Server:** Serves as the backend for handling file uploads and processing.

## Features

- Extracts text from email images using an OCR model.
- Analyzes the extracted text to extract structured information using an NLP model.
- Provides a REST API endpoint for uploading images and receiving extracted details.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-insights-nlp.git
cd email-insights-nlp
```

### Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following contents:

```plaintext
fastapi
uvicorn
tensorflow
numpy
opencv-python
transformers
```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

To start the FastAPI server, run:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Using the API

1. **Endpoint:** `/extract_details`
2. **Method:** POST
3. **Request:**
   - **File:** An image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG) containing the email content.

   Example using `curl`:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/extract_details" -F "file=@path/to/your/image.png"
   ```

   Example using Postman:
   - Set the request type to `POST`.
   - Set the URL to `http://localhost:8000/extract_details`.
   - In the `Body` tab, select `form-data`.
   - Add a key `file` with type `File` and choose the file to upload.

4. **Response:**
   - A JSON object with extracted details.

   ```json
   {
       "details": [ ... ]
   }
   ```

## Training Your Models

### OCR Model

1. **Prepare Your Dataset:** Collect and label images of emails.
2. **Train the Model:** Implement and train your OCR model. Use the TensorFlow/Keras example provided as a starting point.

### NLP Model

1. **Prepare Your Dataset:** Collect and label email text data with the required entities (e.g., email addresses, brands).
2. **Fine-Tune BERT:** Use the provided example to fine-tune a BERT model on your dataset.

## Notes

- Replace `'path_to_your_model'` in the `load_model()` function with the actual path to your trained OCR model.
- The NLP model used in this example is BERT. Depending on your specific requirements, you might need to adjust the model architecture and training process.
